# Anthropic Content Agent - Advanced Workflow

This repository contains a JSON script designed to be the core content generation engine for an advanced, automated content workflow for my two Linkedin companies.(like one built in n8n, Make, or Zapier).

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

This script is the central processing unit for a fully automated content pipeline that runs daily.

| Step | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Trigger** | **Scheduler (e.g., n8n Schedule Trigger)** | The workflow is set to trigger daily at **5:00 AM**. |
| **2. Data Source** | **Google Sheets** | Fetches a list of topics from a designated Google Sheet row where the status is "To Do". |
| **3. Research** | **HTTP Request (Tavily API)** | Performs a web search based on the topic, gathering relevant information from **three articles** to provide context for the AI. |
| **4. Content Generation** | **Anthropic Content Agent (This Script)** | Uses the Anthropic Claude model to perform a multi-step process to create a polished LinkedIn post. |
| **5. Publishing** | **LinkedIn Post Node** | Creates the final post on LinkedIn using the content generated by the agent. |
| **6. Status Update** | **Google Sheets** | Updates the original row in the Google Sheet, setting the status from "To Do" to "Created" and recording the final post content. |

## 🧠 The Anthropic Content Agent's Role

The agent is responsible for transforming raw research into a high-quality, on-brand LinkedIn posts for Mindful Dollar and Think Like a Healer. It uses a **unique prompt** to ensure consistency in voice, tone, and structure.

The agent performs the following three sequential steps:
1.  **Article Generation:** Writes a comprehensive draft based on the topic and research data.
2.  **Post Structuring:** Formats the draft into an engaging, structured LinkedIn post, ready for publishing.
3.  **Grammar/Error Check:** Performs a final quality assurance check to ensure the post is error-free.

### Custom Prompt Integration

The unique prompt used in the `main.py` script (or the n8n Anthropic Chat Node) is the key to defining the brand's voice.

#### Example Prompt Snippet: The Mindful Dollar Tone

To achieve a specific voice, the System Prompt is customized. Here is a short example of the tone instruction:

> **System Prompt Snippet:** "You are a financial coach with a 'Mindful Dollar' philosophy. Your tone is calm, encouraging, and focuses on intentional spending and long-term well-being over quick fixes. Use simple, relatable language and avoid overly aggressive sales tactics."

## 🛠️ Technical Setup (For Code Deployment)

This section is relevant if you are deploying this script as a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda) to be called via an HTTP Request in your workflow.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd anthropic-content-agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    You must set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable during deployment:
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

## 🔌 Integration with Your Workflow

The script is designed to be called with the topic and research data as inputs, and its output (the final LinkedIn post) is used to feed the subsequent publishing and status update steps.

| Input | Source |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Topic` | Output from the Google Sheet node. |
| `Research Data` | Output from the HTTP Request (Tavily) node. |

| Output | Destination |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Final Post Content` | LinkedIn Post Node and Google Sheet Update Node. |
